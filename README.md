- Project Name: Pricing Pal
- Git Repository: https://github.com/CalicoChloe/Thrifty-K9

# Project Description
  This project provides a simple and easy-to-use pricing reference guide to aid charity organizations 
that use a thrift store model to fund their cause. The resulting application will provide a means to 
reference pricing for items based on category or a particular item name. The purpose of the project is
to use technology to replace antiquated pen and paper style documentation that many of these charities
still rely on.
