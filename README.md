# Project-Description
This project provides a simple and easy-to-use pricing reference guide to aid charity organizations
that use a thrift store model to fund their cause. The resulting application will provide a means to
reference pricing for items based on category or a particular item name. Planned functionality for the future includes
list creation/editing, admin authentication, and an in-app search function. The purpose of the project is
to use technology to replace antiquated pen and paper style documentation that many of these charities
still rely on.
