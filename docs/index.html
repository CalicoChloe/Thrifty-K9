            <div class="content">
                <p>We are Team Thrifty-K9, a dedicated team of Software Development students from Georgia Gwinnett College!
                    Pricing Pal is the culmination of our efforts during the Fall 2023 semester,
                    and we hope to see further development (either by ourselves, or through handing the project off to future students).
                    To be more specific, our founding development team consists of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Julian Ellis, team manager</li>
                    <li>Shianne Lesure, UI/UX lead</li>
                    <li>Chloe Jackson, documentation lead</li>
                    <li>Connor Murdock, lead code architect</li>
                    <li>Abdoulie J NJie, testing lead & data modeler</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Roles assigned in this project were supplemental and do not fully reflect our individual contributions. <br>
                    We would also like to thank GGC alumnus Mr. Devin Rogers and our professor, Dr. Rahaf Barakat, for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this project.

            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Pricing Pal is an Android application built with non-profit thrift stores in mind, although it may be useful to others too!
                    We will offer cloud storage and quick editing of basic pricing lists, so that everyone who works in your store can have easy access to your up-to-date pricing list -- no sign-up required.
                    You, as a registered admin user, will be able to create and edit your own pricing lists, in-app, from anywhere with an Internet collection.
                    This project is new and still in development, so keep checking for new features!

                <h3>For Users</h3>
                <p>Currently, Pricing Pal is only available through downloading the APK file from our GitHub repository.
                    Once you have the APK, you can install it on your Android device to see our user interface and basic functionality. Creation of a user account is not yet available.
                    We hope to have the fully-featured app published to the Google Play Store and F-Droid in the near future, at which time those links will be added to the bottom of this page.
                </p>
                <h3>For Developers</h3>
                <p>Our GitHub repository is public, and we welcome any and all contributions to the project.
                    If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
                    We will review your changes and merge them into the main branch if they are acceptable.
