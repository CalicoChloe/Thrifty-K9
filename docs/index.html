        <h2>What is Pricing Pal?</h2>
        <p>Pricing Pal is an Android application built for non-profit thrift stores, although it may be useful to others too!
            We offer cloud storage and quick editing of basic pricing lists, so that everyone who works in your store can have easy access to your up-to-date pricing list -- no sign-up required.
            You, as a registered admin user, can create and edit your own pricing lists, in-app, from anywhere with an Internet collection.
            This is a new project made by a team of students at Georgia Gwinnett College, and we hope you find it useful!

        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <p>We are a dedicated team of Software Development students from Georgia Gwinnett College.
            Pricing Pal is the culmination of our efforts during the Fall 2023 semester,
            and we hope to see further development (either by ourselves, or through handing the project off to future students).
            To be more specific, our founding development team consists of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Julian Ellis, team manager</li>
            <li>Shianne Lesure, UI/UX lead</li>
            <li>Chloe Jackson, documentation lead</li>
            <li>Connor Murdock, lead code architect</li>
            <li>Abdoulie J NJie, testing lead & data modeler</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Roles assigned in this project were supplemental and do not fully reflect our individual contributions. <br>
            We would also like to thank GGC alumnus Mr. Devin Rogers and our professor, Dr. Rahaf Barakat, for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this project.
